# Derivative plots for potentiometric analysis
determination of acetic acid in solution, so in this practice at lab ufma we have to work on manupulating data to get concentration through some steps.
- `get data from spreadsheet`: pandas and numpy are used to import vol and pH values to plot a graph
- `first derivative`: to find equivalence point and determine the vol needed to 
- `second derivative`: it was used for locate the point of inflection at zero on the second derivative point. for while this topic will be discussed with professor iranaldo to get some points
